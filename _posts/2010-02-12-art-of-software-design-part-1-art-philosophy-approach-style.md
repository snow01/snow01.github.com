<blockquote><b>Question: What is Software Design ?</b>
<b>My Answer:</b> Software Design is an ART, A Philosophy, An Approach, A Style.</blockquote>
There is no single answer when it comes to designing a software. It can be done in many many ways. You would see a good book author would stick to some philosophy, a style when writing a book. Similar story when written by different authors bring different aspects, different approaches. Same applies to a painting artist. And I believe same applies to a software designer, the architect.

I believe, for designing a good software, first thing a designer should do is identify his/her own style, if any. Or should start develop his/her own style. If not done right, one can get derailed on the way. There are so many approaches, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by them and in the end the output (productivity) might be very less.

For a given problem, there are so many standards, frameworks (both open source and commercial) in the market. Each try offer some unique thing over other. But most of the time that is not enough to zero down to what standard, what framework to chose.

There are various programming languages to solve the same problem: C, Java, Ruby, Perl, Python, and one new every month. There are various standards and frameworks: EJB, JSF, Zend, Spring, JBoss.

An architect who knows his style of solving the problem, his philosophy, would be able to come up with the solution very quickly. He won't limit his solution with available standards and frameworks. <b>That's how the Real Innovation happens.Â </b>

Because he is not limited by what people has already thought, he might be coming up with new out of the box solutions, which nobody would have thought. Or he might be evolving his own philosophy. <b>That's how the Real Evolution happens - for the whole software community or for the individual.</b>
