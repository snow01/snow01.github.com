### RECOMMENDATIONS

> Shailendra is one of the brightest and most hard working people you will ever come across. During our tenure together at the department, I have seen him grasp things at a great pace and apply them effectively as well. He also displayed a lot of great mentoring skills at a very early stage.  
**Harish	Subramanian**

> Shailendra and I worked for close to 2 years in Consumer Electronics group at Trilogy. As we worked on the same end clients, our activities strongly overlapped each others and this provided me with a close glimpse of his capabilities. Firstly, he is very entrepreneurial in his approach towards technology which helps him transcend traditional boundaries and create new, meaningful things. Its no wonder that he went on to be the CTO/cofounder of a successful startup. Also, he has very strong problem solving skills at the core. I remember him to be able to go through piles of data and still be able to produce product actionable insights which produced disproportionate value. Last but not the least, he has an ability to motivate cross-functional teams and lead them towards a common goal. So, while leading a technology team, he was able to work seamlessly with creative, project management, analytics and legal teams across countries and able to set the final goal, break it down to milestones and make it happen. Needless to say, I would love to work with him again if there is a chance!!

> Shailendra, An absolute intellect, genius, very strong in both technical and managerial domains. I worked with him for almost two years and helped him build his resources. His understanding of his requirement was very clear which helped me in find a right candidate for him. Highly approachable, grounded and with his vast knowledge he adds value to everything he does. He can make a complexed situation look very easy by finding easy and focussed solutions. He is very focussed and determined person. I look upto him as my mentor.Good luck.

> Shailendra is hands-on professional with amazing will-do attitude, technically strong, and inquisitive.  
**Abhinav	Katiyar**



> I know Shailendra since my graduate days at Pune University where we studied together. He comes across as a very diligent, intelligent and inquisitive person. He has always had a very strong desire and determination to do well and succeed in life, backed by excellent technical capabilities and willingness to think out of the box. At Persistent we worked in different groups, but I knew he was doing very well in his team. Making the choice to move to a startup leaving a cushy job behind, is testimony to his strong technical prowess and willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed. I wish him good luck in his future endeavours.

> Shailendra and I met up during the induction of the class of 2003 during July 2000 in Poona. What struck me -- about him -- then was his eagerness to learn and prove himself continuously as a graduate student, and he's kept at it since then. I vividly remember various term assignments, where he was regarded highly by his fellow team-mates for his contributions. He was (and I reckon still is) a good PhD material due to the combination of diligence and inquisitiveness.  
What I liked most in him was his willingness to be open about his findings on any challenging/new topic and to discuss things out for the benefit of the bigger group.  
He has been one of the first guys from the class of 2003 to chart their own course, I admire him for this spirit... His start-up venture, Versé Innovation, is now in thick of business, and I wish him greater success.

> I know Shailendra as an adept software programmer. He has an enquiring and receptive mind. He is creative and is capable of coming up with elegant and out of the box solutions.  
**Vishal	Grover**



> Owing to an inordinate sense of anticipation and forecast, he makes the grade of the most meticulous of planners. It is not a singular quality that separates him from the rest of the entrepreneurs I have worked with, but a variegated assortment of his talents and abilities. With a textbook blend of idealism and realism, he is revered in and outside our firm as a visionary. His giant skillset in technology and an augmentative experience in the industry make him all the more fortified as a leader. He leads by example and he does it very frequently – it does not take subordinates much time to idolize him. As a leader he extensively uses coordinating mechanisms of continuous communication and direct supervision, so much so that even today he chooses not to sit in a personal cabin, lest he misses out on an iota of the team’s progress. His sense of situational awareness is exceptional. As a junior to him and having worked with him for two years, I have picked up traits of doing regular retrospective analyses and detailed forward planning. All in all, he is the ‘front-man’ and a talismanic figure in our firm, and elsewhere, a great ambassador of learning, planning and execution.

> An excellent technologist and architect, Shailendra brings life to an idea and drives it to completion with utmost perfection. A great mentor, he throws challenges to his team that give them immense growth opportunity. With solid foundation in core computer science, he builds powerful systems and solutions. He binds and guides his team with utmost sincerity and passion. He sees through real world problems and comes up with ideas with great business potential.  
Working in Verse under the guidance of Shailendra was the most enriching experience of my life. He mentored me in designing scalable platforms and systems. While working with him on crucial and complex modules in Verse I was able to learn few traits of software architecture from this great software architect.  
Shailendra is gem of a person and is an elder brother to me giving me advice on various aspects of life, helping me overcome personal issues. I always look up to him in times of trouble.  
The very important factors that made me ready to take up the next set of challenges in my professional career were my career track in Verse and the able mentorship of Shailendra. I hold the learning and relationship with Shailendra very close to me. I wish Shailendra all the very best for Verse, his future professional path and life.

> Saying he can build softwares with ease is a very small thing to say rather saying "has the vision and the potential to bring about a change" can describe him well. Shailendra Sir is an individual with great potential. Very calm and composed by nature he has good attitude towards work and life. A superb mentor, helper, advisor, he has a penchant of helping people by solving problems differently and making life easier. With his awesome technical skills he solves problems with ease. He has got great ideas and has the ability to give them life as well. He has been a mentor to me for the past 4 years and I wish him all the best for his life.
